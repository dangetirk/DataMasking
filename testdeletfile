Good Morning Sarah,
There was a problem because our dataset is really large (2.2 million records) and other records i have observed some special character, and it didn't handle special characters well.
I've fixed the script so it can now manage these special characters correctly. I Will send you the updated files for 'SRV_ASSETS' and 'SECURITY_ARRANGEMENTS'.
